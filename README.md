# Regarding deployment of this app on Github Pages
- The deployment process is same as we deploy our React App
- But there was some problem initially.
- The file path was not correct so we have to correct it manually in ```index.html``` and its ```subsequent JS file.```
- The file path was changed from ```/assets/...``` to ```assets/...``` so that the GitHub Pages could access the assests folder in the same branch.
